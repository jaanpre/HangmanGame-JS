## Info
Well, this is my first project. It has some issues and inadequacies (no RWD, no BEM, no OOP), because I was just a beginner as I had been working on it :) I'm not going to fix these, but You are free to do that :)

## Hangman
A classic word guessing game, written in JavaScript. You have to guess what the word is, one letter at a time. Guess wrong too many times, and you lose!

Check out the demo! https://mateusz-pocztowski.github.io/HangmanGame-JS/

## How to play?

Gameplay is fairly simple: You're presented with a blank line. The number of blanks is the number of letters in the word. You'll be prompted to guess a letter. If the word contains the letter you enter, you'll fill in the blanks. If not, a part of the man is added to the gallows. Complete the entire man and you lose! Complete the entire word and you win!
