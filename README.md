Gameplay is fairly simple: You're presented with a blank line. The number of blanks is the number of letters in the word. You'll be prompted to guess a letter. If the word contains the letter you enter, you'll fill in the blanks. If not, a part of the man is added to the gallows. Complete the entire man and you lose! Complete the entire word and you win!
