## Hangman
A classic word guessing game, written in JavaScript. You have to guess what the word is, one letter at a time. Guess wrong too many times, and you lose!

Gameplay is fairly simple: You're presented with a blank line. The number of blanks is the number of letters in the word. You'll be prompted to guess a letter. If the word contains the letter you enter, you'll fill in the blanks. If not, a part of the man is added to the gallows. Complete the entire man and you lose! Complete the entire word and you win!
